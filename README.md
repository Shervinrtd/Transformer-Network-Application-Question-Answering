# Transformer-Network-Application-Question-Answering


Result:

Perform extractive Question Answering
Fine-tune a pre-trained transformer model to a custom dataset
Implement a QA model in TensorFlow and PyTorch



Problem Statement:

Question answering (QA) is a task of natural language processing that aims to automatically answer questions. The goal of extractive QA is to identify the portion of the text that contains the answer to a question. For example, when tasked with answering the question 'When will Jane go to Africa?' given the text data 'Jane visits Africa in September', the question answering model will highlight 'September'.


warning: I did this project from my courses in coursera.org so if you have this project now please dont check the codes it is so important to think about them
